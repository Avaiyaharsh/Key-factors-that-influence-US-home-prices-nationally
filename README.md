# Key-factors-that-influence-US-home-prices-nationally
This project analyzes and predicts U.S. housing prices using various macroeconomic and demographic indicators such as CPI, unemployment rate, interest rates, income, urban population, and more. Data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques are applied to model the housing price index trends.
# U.S. Housing Price Prediction Using Economic Indicators

This project focuses on predicting U.S. housing prices using various macroeconomic, financial, and demographic indicators. The goal is to understand how factors such as interest rates, inflation, employment, and population trends influence the housing market.

## Project Highlights

- Data Merging and Cleaning from Multiple Sources
- Feature Engineering and Missing Value Handling
- Visualizations: Histograms, Correlation Heatmaps
- Regression Modeling for House Price Prediction
- Use of Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

---

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

---

## Model Building

We experimented with different regression models to predict the housing price index:
- Linear Regression
- ElasticNet
- Random Forest 
- XG Boost
- SVR (support vector regression)
-Gradiant boosting
 
# Results

The project involves understanding and predicting patterns rather than just describing historical trends or providing actionable recommendations.
